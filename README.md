# Spark-Funds

Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.

Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:
1. It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
2. It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in

Check the link below for a list of countries where English is an official language.
